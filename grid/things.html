<p>&emsp;<b>The</b> Town of Topsail Beach offers vacationers a variety of activities during their stay.  We have a beautiful beach in which vacationers can enjoy sunbathing, swimming, surfing, fishing or whatever their favorite beach activity may be.  In addition to the beach, we have a beautiful soundfront with access to the Intercoastal Waterway and nearby Lea Island.  The Town's Marina provides boaters with all the accommodations necessary for their water activities.  For those that prefer to stay on land, Serenity Point offers beachgoers fantastic views of the sound and waterway. <br></p>

<p>&emsp;<b>The</b> origins of Topsail Beach as a small coastal fishing town is evident at the Jolly Roger Fishing Pier, where king mackerel fisherman demonstrate their fishing skills at the very end of the pier or spot fisherman stand shoulder to shoulder in the fall.  For those who prefer fishing off shore or a sunset cruise, you can make a reservation on the headboat Queen Jean.<br></p>

<p>&emsp;<b>For</b> those looking for a slightly more relaxing vacation the Town of Topsail Beach has several unique shops and restaurants catering to all ages and tastes.  After a day of eating and shopping you can skate a few laps around the Topsail Island Skating Rink or play a round of putt-putt at the Patio Playground.  Or you can stop by the Missiles and More Museum and learn some of the history of Topsail Beach during WWII.<br></p>
